== Description ==
Correct your typos as you type. You are typing the sentence "Teh place ur saying is too far from here"
In this sentence, you type "Teh" instead of "The" and "ur" instead of "you are", so when you hit space key after
typing "Teh", "Teh" is replaced by "The" and when you press "ur" and then press space key, "ur" is gone and "you are" is there
at its place. You should inform the plugin via settings page, which word is to be replaced by which one.
